# 4 perfect squares
A leetcode problem like.

## About The Question
It is a well-known fact that any positive integer can be written as the sum of at most four perfect squares. Given an integer n, find the length of the smallest list of perfect squares that add up to n.

Examples:

- SumOfSquares(5) = 2 

5 = 4 + 1 (4 and 1 are perfect squares).

- SumOfSquares(15) = 4 

15 = 9 + 4 + 1 + 1. There is no way to represent 15 as the sum of three squares.

- SumOfSquares(16) = 1 

16 itself is a perfect square.

## About Why Publish this codes
A manager in the workplace said that this is a so difficult problem, and even the programmer from the best universities in China, cannot solve it too. But when I saw it, I felt it is not difficult, so I did nothing to solve it. And he still thought it is difficult. So I started to solve it.

After one pomodo, here is it. And u r right, it is more like a bet with him.
